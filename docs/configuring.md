# Configuring grunt

## The config file, aka "gruntfile"
Each time grunt is run, it looks in the current directory for a file named `grunt.js`, and if not found, continues looking in parent directories until that file is found. This file is typically placed in the root of your project repository, and is a valid JavaScript file comprised of two parts:

1. Project configuration
2. [Tasks](tasks.md) and [helpers](helpers_directives.md)

## Project configuration

Each grunt task relies on configuration information defined in a single `config.init()` call in the gruntfile. Usually, this information is specified in task-named sub-properties of a main configuration object. It's not as complicated as it sounds.

For example, this simple configuration would define a list of files to be linted when the "lint:files" sub-task was run on the command line like this: `grunt lint:files`.

```javascript
config.init({
  lint: {
    files: ['lib/*.js', 'test/*.js', 'grunt.js']
  }
});
```

_Note: because the "lint" task is a [basic task](tasks.md), you can also run _all_ lint sub-tasks with just `grunt lint`._

You can store any arbitrary information inside of the configuration object, and as long as it doesn't conflict with a property one of your tasks is using, it will be ignored.

```javascript
config.init({
  // Generic project information used by some helpers and tasks.
  meta: {},
  // Lists of files to be concatenated, used by the "concat" task.
  concat: {},
  // Lists of files to be linted with JSHint, used by the "lint" task.
  lint: {},
  // Lists of files to be minififed with UglifyJS, used by the "min" task.
  min: {},
  // Lists of files or URLs to be unit tested with QUnit, used by the "qunit" task.
  qunit: {},
  // Configuration options for the "server" task.
  server: {},
  // Lists of files to be unit tested with Nodeunit, used by the "test" task.
  test: {},
  // Configuration options for the "watch" task.
  server: {},
  // Global configuration options for JSHint.
  jshint: {},
  // Global configuration options for UglifyJS.
  uglify: {}
});
```

_Note: you don't need to specify configuration settings for tasks that you don't use._

## Example gruntfiles

Take a look at these example gruntfiles to see a few of the possible variations:

* [Sample jQuery plugin gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt-jquery-example/blob/master/grunt.js) (as generated by the `init:jquery` task)
* [Sample CommonJS module gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt-commonjs-example/blob/master/grunt.js) (as generated by the `init:commonjs` task)
* [Sample Node.js npm module gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt-node-example/blob/master/grunt.js) (as generated by the `init:node` task)
* [javascript-hooker's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker/blob/master/grunt.js)
* [glob-whatev's gruntfile](https://github.com/cowboy/node-glob-whatev/blob/master/grunt.js)
